some discord bot that will someday do neat things for a server

this was closed source but its not now. git history gone cause there was a token in there and i cba to figure out how to get that out of there

the code is shit and im aware of that. if you wanna point out rarted things im doing so i can do it better then go for it gamer

## setup

just `npm ci`  to install dependencies

copy defaultconfig.json to config.json and put a token in

then `npm run` to start. do this in a screen/tmux preferably

you can update from the master branch with `npm run update`
